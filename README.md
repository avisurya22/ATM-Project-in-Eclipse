# ATM-Project-in-Eclipse
It is Money ATM project which gives facilities to user to check, withdraw and deposit the funds. Code is written in java. Created mainly three classes name ATMstart, Menu, and Account in which account is parent class of Menu class and Menu is parent class of ATMStart class. Allowed to enter the user account number and password check for authorization. Currently only two details I mapped using a hashmap. Each class contains several methods declaration and their definitions are written in the parent class. Menu class shows Menu to select bank account type between current and savings further it will take the user to the menu about what to do with their bank account i.e.They want to check, deposit or withdraw the balance. All the logic part related to operations on amount like calculating the amount after withdrawal or deposition is written in Account class
